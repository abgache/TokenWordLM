# TokenWordLM
TokenWordLM or TWLM is a simple test language model.
# Version 1:
## Info:
This is a test language model, a bad one.
In the V1 of TWLM a token is equal to a word (french one, [json dictionnary](https://github.com/words/an-array-of-french-words)).
It has context lenght of 2 tokens.
No embeddings, the DNN just get the two last token id's.

```batch
git clone https://github.com/abgache/TokenWordLM.git
cd TokenWordLM
pip install requirements.txt
python main.py
```
